The master of data science in computational linguistics course started in September 2019. So far, i am really enjoying the masters program. I created this blog for the DSCI 521 course lab 2. 

Just to give a brief introduction about myself, i completed my bachelors degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in Applied Math and Statistics.
